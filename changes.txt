v1: 
added self.qubitCircLeadSizes =  ([2, 20], [10, 100])
      self.qubitCircRadius = 200
as new parameters to the default config class.

edited def qubitLead():

now has a new argument: isCirc. If true, the qubit will be drawn with circular pads, whos radius is specified in self.qubitCircRadius
One thing to look out far is the overlap between the coarseLead and the Circle. 
Currently, the generic value
	self.qubitLeadOverlap =       1.5   
is used.
added snake Resonator.

v1.1: 
changes in the individual pythonfiles. 
Pengtao request the boarder for the fine Lead and corse Lead of the qubit to be in a different Layer. For this,
I adjusted the code. 
First, the boarder of the merged Leads is created to be used as a mask. Then, I create the boarder for both the coarse Lead and fine Lead individually.
Finally, I use the created mask for an and operation on the indiviudall borders.
Also, the createboarder function was adjusted to allow picking a layer. Previously, all borders were in the same layer.
