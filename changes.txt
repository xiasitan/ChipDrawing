v1: 
added self.qubitCircLeadSizes =  ([2, 20], [10, 100])
      self.qubitCircRadius = 200
as new parameters to the default config class.

edited def qubitLead():

now has a new argument: isCirc. If true, the qubit will be drawn with circular pads, whos radius is specified in self.qubitCircRadius
One thing to look out far is the overlap between the coarseLead and the Circle. 
Currently, the generic value
	self.qubitLeadOverlap =       1.5   
is used.


added snake Resonator.
